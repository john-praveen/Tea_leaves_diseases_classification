# Tea Leaves Diseases Classification

This project implements a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify diseases in tea leaves. The model is trained on a publicly available Kaggle dataset and can identify seven common tea leaf diseases.

## About the Dataset

The tea leaf disease dataset contains images showing the following seven common diseases:

- Red Leaf Spot
- Algal Leaf Spot
- Birdâ€™s Eyespot
- Gray Blight
- White Spot
- Anthracnose
- Brown Blight

## Features

- Custom CNN architecture designed for tea leaf disease classification.
- Handles 7 types of diseases.
- Can be extended for real-time classification with camera input.
- Includes preprocessing, training, and evaluation scripts.
